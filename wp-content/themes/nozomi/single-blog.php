                            <p>There is no secret that the mobile app industry is now booming, putting other sectors aside. According to Statista, there are over 2 million apps on App Store as of the first quarter of 2021 compared to just 500 apps in 2008. Each year it’s becoming harder and harder to compete in the mobile industry. So, how to stand out from the ever-expanding number of similar apps? Product and UI/UX design plays a huge role here.</p>
                            <p>We highlighted the key UX principals that help to combat the competition in one of the most complicated and diverse industries — Health & Fitness. Design here is not about simple assembling and editing, it is all about value, help, simplifying and making the world a better place. More than that, design in H&F is about empathy and the connection between humans and apps. Before, most healthcare apps were poorly designed, resulting in a bad user experience and possibly making life seem even more complicated. It’s great to see the major change in the industry now, with people attaching more importance to design. As a result, more and more H&F apps started to look aesthetic and change people’s lives for the better.</p>
                            <blockquote>The aesthetics of your product speaks out for you just as much as the functionality, because if the functionality is no longer unique, guess what steps in? The beauty.</<blockquote>
                            <p>So, here are 3 main UX principals— Engagement, Trust and Emotions. We have identified them based on the analysis of the health and wellness market, as well as the applications of our partners in this industry. Today I’d like to dwell on the ways of implementing these principals. They could be used not only in the H&F sector but also in mobile applications in general.</p>    
                            <h3>Engagement</h3>
                            <p>Getting people to download your mobile app is one thing, keeping those people engaged is another thing, engaging users in the long run — is almost impossible. But there is a trend that spans across industries and motivates users to take meaningful actions, again and again.</p>
                            <p>There is a coffee shop in Minsk where you can participate in a small lottery called “Dessert in a bag”. The rules are simple: you pay a symbolic fee and pull out a piece of paper with a random dessert. It’s an excellent way to make customers buy desserts even if they don’t want to eat. The success recipe is simple: people are willing to spend money as long as it’s fun and engaging — this is the psychology of lotteries. You probably guessed what trend I’m talking about. Gamification is everywhere, not only in the digital world.</p>
                            <p>If we take a closer look at the statistics of the most popular categories on the App Store, we’ll see that Games are far ahead of others. So why don’t other apps implement gamification features?</p>
                            <p>Of course, they’ve already done it. Previously, gamification was most commonly used in e-learning apps (e.g. Duolingo).</p>
                            <img title="" src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() ?>/assets/images/blog/blog-02-min.jpg" alt=""/> 
                            <p>Now gamification is welcomed not only in e-learning, but also in fintech, productivity apps and health & fitness.</p>
                            <p>Why is gamification becoming so popular in healthcare? Because it motivates users to learn new skills and develop healthy behaviors in an effortless and engaging way.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                Gamification is a design that places most emphasis on human motivation in the process. In essence, it’s a human-focused design. Yu Kai Chou
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>What gamification elements do H&F apps use?</p>
                            <h4>1.Points, badges and other types of rewards.</h4>
                            <p>Users can receive these rewards for their actions in the app. They can further exchange them for something else (additional features, “lives”, new content, your character upgrades and other benefits). Some apps even use real-life awards like store discount coupons (e.g. Mango Health).</p>
                            <img title="" src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() ?>/assets/images/blog/blog-03-min.jpg" alt=""/> 
                            <h4>2. Challenges with friends and leaderboard.</h4>
                            <p>Everything is easier when you’re doing it with someone else. You can support each other when going through the tasks. Moreover, competing with someone gives you additional motivation to take on the challenge and win.</p>
                            <img title="" src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() ?>/assets/images/blog/blog-04-min.jpg" alt=""/> 
                            <h4>3.Performance charts.</h4>
                            <p>These graphs show your progress compared to the previous results. It is important for people to see the progress of how he goes to his aim and some intermediate results.</p>
                            <h4>4.Content presented in a gamified way.</h4>
                            <p>Apps present the content in the quiz format, dividing it into small chunks to make them easier to complete. All the content is structured by levels: from the easiest one to the most complicated.</p> 
                            <p>It’s not necessary to implement all the elements. Mental wellness apps use challenges, quizzes, rewards to make users’ way to obtaining emotional wellbeing more interactive and engaging. Fitness apps use badges, like those for steps you walk, and social engagement to make users challenge their friends and motivate them to reach their fitness goals in a fun way. And it works because the human brain is constantly seeking new challenges.</p> 
                            <h3>Trust</h3>
                            <p>Trust is a fundamental element in the healthcare industry. If patients do not trust their clinicians, they will not be willing to follow their diagnoses and recommended treatments. The same thing with apps in the H&F industry. Brands compete to gain trust among the users and offer the one-off solution to cater to their needs.</p> 
                            <p>Here’re the ways that help H&F apps build trust among their users:</p> 
                            <ul>
                                <ol>

                                Social proofs
                                </ol>
                                <ol>
                                Content personalisation
                                </ol>
                                <ol>
                                Social proofs
                                </ol>                
                            </ul>
